  <h3>Why dogs need special food?</h3>
  <p>
The nutritional balance of the dog is different from that of different animals and also different from that of humans.
There are foods that we eat that a dog can certainly eat, but nevertheless there are foods that are foreign to the dog's body that may harm his health and even cause poisoning.
The dog's nutritional needs are all obtained from the food intended for dogs and maintain a correct and healthy balance and also clean his teeth. Even when the dog wants us to honor him with our food, we must do this in addition to the dog's special food, 
and this is also done only after consulting a veterinarian about the food that a dog can eat and the food that he is not allowed to eat.
Also, the balance of adult dogs is different from that of puppies and cats, so it is forbidden to mix the foods. Cats and puppies need higher levels of protein than adult dogs, and damage to the amount of protein may lead to health problems. In addition to this, special attention should be paid to the taurine component that is found in cat food and is not found in dog food.
 Its absence from the cat's diet may significantly damage the cat's vision and lead to heart problems.
 Therefore, one must give thought to the correct distribution of food in order to maintain a correct nutritional balance for all members of the household.
