  <h3>Why dogs need special food?</h3>
  <p>
    The nutritional balance of the dog is different from that of different animals and also different from that of humans.
    There are foods that we eat that a dog can certainly eat, 
    <br>
    but nevertheless there are foods that are foreign to the dog's body that may harm his health  and even cause poisoning. 
    <br>
    The dog's nutritional needs are all obtained from the food intended for dogs and maintain a correct and healthy balance and also clean his teeth. 
    <br>
    Even when the dog wants us to honor him with our food, we must do this in addition to the dog's special food,
   <br>
    and this is also done only after consulting a veterinarian 
    about the food that a dog can eat and the food that he is not allowed to eat.
<br>
 Also, the balance of adult dogs is different from that of puppies and cats, so it is forbidden to mix the foods. 
<br>
 Cats and puppies need higher levels of protein than adult dogs, and damage to the amount of protein may lead to health problems. In addition to this,
<br>
 special attention should be paid to the taurine component that is found in cat food and is not found in dog food.
<br>
 Its absence from the cat's diet may significantly damage the cat's vision and lead to heart problems. 
 <br>
 Therefore, one must give thought to the correct distribution of food in order to maintain a correct nutritional balance for all members of the household.

<h3>Should the food be adapted to the dog's activity?</h3>
<p>
Just like humans, a more physically active dog will need a high protein food to help build muscle as well as a higher caloric intake to maintain a normal energy level.
<br>
Accordingly, dogs who are overweight may suffer from health problems just like humans,
<br>
and they should be matched with dietary food that will correct their caloric balance and lead them to a healthy weight.
<br>
Consult the veterinarian to establish a proper diet for the dog according to its weight and activity level and thus maintain a healthy balance.
</p>

<h3>How does the size of the dog affect the choice of food?</h3>
<p>
  Large and small dogs need food of a different nature or with different vitamins to help their bodies deal with problems that may arise as a result of their size. 
  <br>
  Large dogs may suffer from joint problems which are a result of their rapid development and large size. 
  <br>
  Therefore, food intended for large dogs includes special vitamins that control the rate of growth and coats for the cartilage of the joints to prevent such problems that may arise. 
  <br>
  Small dogs, on the other hand, tend to be more active and therefore will consume more protein. 
  <br>
  In addition, the small mouth needs a smaller type of granules to make it easier for them to chew.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Does the dog's age require different food?</h3>
<p>
  Just as puppies need puppy food, so do adult dogs need special food. 
  <br>
  In old age, the heart and joints weaken and low-calorie food is needed to ease them. In addition, 
  <br>
  food rich in nutritional supplements will renew the cartilage and thus alleviate joint problems that may arise in older dogs.
</p>

<br>
<h3>The difference between lamb, salmon and chicken based foods?</h3>
<p>
  Chicken-based food is the usual food for dogs, but there are dogs that respond better to salmon or lamb in terms of health or personal preference.
  <br>
  Different types of protein will have different physical effects that may manifest in the appearance of the fur and the amount of feces.
  <br>
  Different dogs will react differently to the different food bases and the selection is on the market so that we can adjust the food preferred by our dog. 
  <br>
  In addition to this, sensitivity to chicken is common in dogs and therefore there are substitutes in the form of lamb-based food and salmon-based food,
  <br>
  so that the dog can maintain a correct nutritional balance and not be harmed as a result of an allergy.
</p>

<h3>In conclusion</h3>
<p>
  A dog's diet is very important for its health, body condition and behavior. 
  <br>
  A dog that eats right will be stronger, 
  more energetic and suffer less from medical problems. 
  <br>
  Consultation with experts in the field will help build the most appropriate nutritional balance for your dog and thus maintain his health.
